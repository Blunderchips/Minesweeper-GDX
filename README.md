# Minesweeper-GDX
Minesweeper implemented in libGDX. Originally developed in the 1960â€™s I dare say that everyone has at least seen a version of Minesweeper in action if they have not played it themselves. I am using [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) and [VisUI](https://github.com/kotcrab/vis-ui). All images come from [game-icons.net](http://game-icons.net/).
